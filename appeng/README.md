# [Engineering Playbook](../README.md) / Application Engineering

## Overview

Application Engineering is the practice area at Truss focused on delivering software applications--including and mostly dealing with web development. A portion of this work pertains to how Application Engineers organize as a practice, while most will discuss how we develop software.

Topics range from languages and high level frameworks (Django, RoR, Golang), through specific usage patterns like how to best use Redux as a data store for Flux based single page Javascript apps, down to particulars like how to manage session state in an HTTP based application.
