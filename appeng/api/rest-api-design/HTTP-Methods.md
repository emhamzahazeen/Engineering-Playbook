When using HTTP methods like PUT or GET in your REST API, it's important to comply with their definitions under the [HTTP/1.1 Standard](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods).

The most important ones will be covered here.

## GET

The GET method requests a specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

Example: This request returns a list of moves from the server.

```
GET /v1/moves HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
```

## POST

The POST method is used to send data to create/update a type of resource.

Example: This request creates a shipment by sending a body with the shipment data.

```
POST /v1/shipments/ HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "shipmentType": "UHAUL",
    "destinationAddress": {
        "streetAddress1": "812 S 129th Street",
        "city": "San Diego",
        "state": "CA",
        "postalCode": "92102"
    },
}
```

## PATCH

The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource.

Example: This request updates two fields on a shipment that exists on the server.

```
PUT /v1/shipments/01b9671e-b268 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
    "shipmentType": "UPS",
    "deliveryDate": "2020-11-08"
}
```

## PUT

The PUT method is used to send data to create/update a specified resource but it is generally used to replace an existing resource, rather than create a new one.

Example: Update an address by replacing with a complete address resource.

```
PUT /v1/mto-shipment/c548a243-9705/address/701a2bf8 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "streetAddress1": "3373 NW Martin Luther King Jr Blvd",
  "city": "Alameda",
  "state": "CA",
  "postalCode": "94501",
  "country": "USA"
}
```

The PUT method is idempotent, which means calling the same PUT request multiple times **must** always produce the same result.

Calling PUT five times will repeatedly replace the same resource, with the same result. Calling POST five times will create 5 instances of the resource.

## DELETE

The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
