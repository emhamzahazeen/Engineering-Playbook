# [Engineering Playbook](../../../README.md) / [Web Development](../../README.md) / [API Guide](../README.md) / REST API Design

Most of this structure was pulled from [https://apiguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html](https://apiguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) which is an API guide written by the AusDTO which appears to be the Aussie version of the U.S. Digital Services.

I pulled in all the questions that were solicited from our meetings within the team into the different headings, to help illuminate what goes in the section but also to ensure our guide answers our own questions.

## Overview

### Audience

This guide is for developers of an API, including:

* Engineers starting on a project looking to develop a REST API
* Feature leads for API development
* Individual developer implementing / extending / testing an API

## Principles

I like the concept of shared principles, so I'm including this section here. But ideally we share principles between the GraphQL and REST API guides, and this moves up a level.

These principles were copied from [https://apiguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/principles/index.html](https://apiguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/principles/index.html) and don't need to be our principles, but they are listed here to prompt thought and discussion.

We will first be focusing on the **Building REST APIs** section. And will decide our principles in collaboration with the GraphQL documentation team.

* Developer empathy
* Functionality
* Ubiquitous standards
* Special technologies
* Endpoint stability
* Security
* Documentation
* Dogfooding (need better terminology)

## Building REST APIs

* [HTTP Methods](HTTP-Methods.md) - Use HTTP methods and status codes correctly

* [URL Design](URL-Design.md) - How to pick the right URL for your endpoint.

  * URL Depth
  * Using plurals for the objects
  * Noun vs. verb endpoints
  * Good and bad RESTful url examples
* [Style Guide](Style-Guide.md) - Simple style guide for a REST API
  * Cases for url and body
  * Linter to enforce rules

* [Data Design](Data-Design.md)
  * Path, Query, Body and Header Parameters
  * Security considerations related to parameter location

* [Error Response Strategy](Error-Response-Strategy.md) - **COMPLETED**

* How are requests for multiple nested objects handled? - **Sandy/Shimona to deliver 20201209**
  * Which IDs for which objects are required? Itâ€™s possible that in a nested set-up that some IDs for children could be found by the system without user input
  * Which IDs should be in the path?
    * May be able to reference this MilMove ADR: [0045-nesting-swagger-paths.md](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/docs/adr/0045-nesting-swagger-paths.md)
  * Which object is considered the parent? Which object is most important from a data integrity perspective?
    * May be able to reference this MilMove ADR: [0049-etag-for-child-updates.md](https://github.com/transcom/mymove/blob/master/docs/adr/0049-etag-for-child-updates.md)
  * If an update fails for one of the nested objects, how will that affect the entire transaction? Should the entire update fail in that case?

* Versioning
  * How are we versioning the api and how does that effect work on any one endpoint?
  * When is it ok to make a breaking API change?  How is that communicated?

* Batching, filtering and paginating results
  * How is filtering handled? And sorting!

* Security
  * What security considerations should I be aware of
  * What is/are valid authentication strategies for contacting the API?
  * Is CORS applicable? What client(s) can access it?
  * Is MTLS supported or required, how is authorization and revocation handled
  * How are permissions handled? What if there are different levels of permissions?

* Data coherence strategies
  * [Concurrency Control](Concurrency-Control.md) - **COMPLETED**
    * Optimistic Locking
  * Is the API data cached? Should the client cache it? When should it be refreshed?

* Document your API
  * How are we documenting the api and what level of documentation is expected?
  * How should I indicate how an endpoint is supposed to be used? Is there a description template?
