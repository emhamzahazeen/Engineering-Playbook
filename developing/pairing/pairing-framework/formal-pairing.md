## Session process

### Check-in

(How’s the day going? What are we working on today? How do we want to work together? How do you prefer to pair?)

### Mid-Session Check-ins

(Set a timer or an alert to check in and ensure you’re staying on target for the goals you’ve set.)

### Notes

(As you can, note any questions that come up, insights you uncover, TILs, and use this space as "scrap paper" while you work.)

### Resources used

(Include links to any documentation, slack messages, etc. you use while working. This can be filled in at the end of the session.)

## Session wrap up

### Next steps

(Note any tasks that remain. Do you need another pairing session? Are there tests to write? Also, record any bugs or other discovered work so they can be brought back to the team to discuss opening any new tickets.)

### Retro

(Allow a few moments at the end of the session to review)

#### The work

- Were the goals achieved?
- Was the work unblocked?
- Was new work uncovered?

#### The session

- Did distractions sneak in?
- Did the session feel like a grind at any point?
- Did you split the work up well?

Is there anything you would like to try next time?
