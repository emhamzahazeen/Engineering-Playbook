# [Pairing](../README.md) / A Pairing Framework

There is a tendency during pairing to get lost in the weeds, chasing down bugs or going down various rabbit holes. By using these templates, pairs can keep on track to solve the specific goal at hand.

They provides a place for:

- The pairing requestor to prepare for the session
- The requestor and partner to take notes during the session
- Recording next steps and a brief retro on the session

## Goals of the framework

- Establishing the purpose of the session
- Providing both partners as much information as possible before the session begins
- Providing a place to take notes
- Establishing a consistent format
- Setting boundaries on the session

## Non-goals of the framework

- Determining when to pair and when not to.
- Moving Truss to a “all pairing all the time” model.
- Enforcing a particular pairing style.
- Prescribing any particular tools.

## The framework templates

There are four iterations of the framework that can be used for a variety of purposes. While at first they seem engineering-focused, they are flexible enough to be used cross-practice.

- [Formal pairing](./formal-pairing.md) - The full menu, filled in by requestor
- [Support pairing](./support-pairing.md) - Down to business, fill things in together
- [Mentoring](./mentoring-pairing.md) - Focus on learning
- [Information sharing/Planning](./planning-pairing.md) - We’re explorers!

## Tips on using the framework

It is suggested that the person requesting the pairing session prepares this document and sends it to the pair partner before the session. This is an important step when using this template as a mentoring tool and the mentee should be the one to fill it out for their own learning experience.

- Any bugs, discovered work, and other research should be notated in "Next steps".
- Setting a timer is key - Time flies when you’re having fun

The more often you pair program, the easier it gets!
