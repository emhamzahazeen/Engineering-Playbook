# [Tools and Practice](../README.md) / CI/CD

The release process is one of the most important parts of development
for obvious reasons: without a release, your code is never going to
actually be used by anyone. What follows are resources for setting
up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline
according to Truss best practices to deliver software to customers.

* [Intro to CI/CD](intro.md)
* [Standard Delivery Pipeline](delivery-pipeline.md)
* [CircleCI Config Patterns](circleci-patterns.md)
* [CircleCI Orbs](circleci-orbs.md)
* [CircleCI Utilities](circleci-utilities.md)
* [Dependabot](dependabot.md)
