# [Engineering Playbook](../README.md) / InfraSec

Infrastructure and security engineering (infrasec) is the practice of
building secure, robust systems that are foundational to having reliable
applications and services. While infrastructure as code is a core area
for this practice, it also involves system design, [incident
response](../incident-response/README.md), and a number of other fields.

## Theory

- [InfraSec Practice Charter](charter.md) - How we think about the Truss InfraSec Practice.
- [Good Infrastructure - A Philosophy](good-infra.md) — How we think about building good infrastructure.
- :lock: [InfraSec "Book" Club - Talk and Article Suggestions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0GDtCMrPnl_Zdpo0qEtaxUW4SocxnZairCM9JQAcyo/edit) — Talks and articles we :sparkling_heart:.

## Practice

- [AWS](aws/README.md) — Our primary cloud provider.
- [Terraform](terraform/README.md) — Our primary infrastructure as code (IaC) tool.
- [Ansible](ansible/README.md) — For when we have to build non-container based images (e.g., AMIs).
