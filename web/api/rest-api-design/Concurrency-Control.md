When you have more than one client using your API, you might want to think about concurrency control.

Consider any data a client can read and update on the server, let's call that a resource.

Most clients retrieve a copy of the resource, update it locally and then send the update some time later. If you have more than one client, it's possible for a client to send an update that is now out of date with changes on the server. It will unintentionally overwrite changes that others have made.

## Optimistic Locking

Optimistic locking is one strategy for handling this issue in your API.

In an optimistic locking scheme, you only allow a resource to be updated after you verify that the resource hasn't been modified since the client last checked.

You can do this with an *eTag*. An eTag is an identifier for the version of the underlying resource.

When the client requests a resource, you return an eTag that identifies the version they received. When they wish to update that resource, the eTag they send must match the current version in the database.

### Optimistic Locking Example

#### Step 1 - Client requests resource

When the client requests information about a shipment, they get an etag for that version of the record.

Request:

```
GET /v1/shipments/99783f4d-ee83 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
Content-Type: application/json
```

Response, notice the `eTag` value:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Body:
{
  "eTag": "MjAyMC0xMi0wMVQxODo1NjoxMy4zNjkxNzRa",
  "shipmentType": "UHAUL",
  "deliveryDate": "2020-06-01"
  "destinationAddress": {
    "streetAddress1": "812 S 129th Street",
    "city": "San Diego",
    "state": "CA",
    "postalCode": "92102"
  },
}

```

This eTag was created by hashing the last updated date of the record.

#### Step 2 - Client updates resource

Then when the client wishes to update this resource, they send the eTag in the `If-Match` header of the PUT or PATCH request.

Request, notice the `If-Match` in the header:

```
PATCH /v1/shipments/01b9671e-b268 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.move.mil
Content-Type: application/json
If-Match: MjAyMC0xMi0wMVQxODo1NjoxMy4zNjkxNzRa
Body:
{
    "shipmentType": "UPS",
    "deliveryDate": "2020-06-08"
}
```

If the eTag matches the resource in our database (which we can check by rehashing the lastUpdated date), we return a `200 Success` Response.

If the eTag does not match, we do not update the resource and we return the `412 Precondition Failed` response.

This would only happen if another client had updated the data in the meanwhile. The client must then re-request the data to get the latest eTag.
